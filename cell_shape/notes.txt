Segmentation seems to work fine with canny edge detection :
Gaussian sigma: 2
Absolute threshold 0.1
threshold adjustment factor 1.0

Problem inYoshi video: some frames are blurred. Some cells are moving in 3dimensions(?) so edge detection performs unequally

Wavelets: questions
-Is it necessary to use the HF channels for reconstruction (if we want to denoise?)
-Histogram equalization?
